        <p>Tiawps is a tool for decrypting sniffed wow sessions and storing them in sqlite databases. Sniffing and decrypting are separated processes.</p>
        <h3>Guide</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a sniffer which is able to store in the libpcap format. <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/">Tcpdump</a> and <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> are known to do this.</li>
            <li>Start sniffing everything on TCP port 3724.</li>
            <li>Start wow and log in.</li>
            <li>Use reader.bat to extract the encryption key from the running wow process. A KEY*.txt file will be created.</li>
            <li>Play around and do whatever you want to</li>
            <li>Stop wow and stop sniffing</li>
            <li>Save the sniffer dump in a libpcap compatible format<br /> <img src="pic_01.png" /></li>
            <li>Drag both KEY*.txt and *.cap to decrypter.bat<br /> <img src="pic_02.png" /></li>
            <li>You should now see a window which says "Finished decrypting 1 of 1 connections". A *.sqlite should have been created which contains the decrypted session.<br />
