tiawps is a wow packet sniffer
--------
How to compile:

I used dev-cpp to build the executables, but it has been reported it works also with cygwin. However, this
how-to will stick to dev-cpp

[IF you don't have the sqlite libs natively installed (if in doubt: do it anyway)]
    *  Open the src/sqlite/sqlite.dev project file with devcpp
    *  Compile this project
[/IF]
*  Do the same with src/decrypter/tiawps_reader.dev
*  Do the same with src/decrypter/tiawps_decrypter.dev
